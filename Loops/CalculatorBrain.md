1.Class Declaration
The class CalculatorBrain is defined. It will contain methods for basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
java
Copy code
public class CalculatorBrain {

}
*************

2. Main Method
The main method is the starting point of the program. This is where the program begins execution.
**************
3. Creating an Object of CalculatorBrain
Inside the main method, an object of the CalculatorBrain class is created.
This object (calculator) is used to call the various arithmetic methods (add, subtract, multiply, divide).

CalculatorBrain calculator = new CalculatorBrain();
****************
4. Calling Arithmetic Methods
The program then calls the different methods (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on the calculator object.
The methods take two numbers (10 and 5) as inputs and return the result of the operation.

java
Copy code
int add = calculator.add(10, 5);
int sub = calculator.subtract(10, 5);
int mul = calculator.multiply(10, 5);
double div = calculator.divide(10, 5);
double divResult = calculator.divide(10, 0); // To test division by zero

The variable add stores the result of 10 + 5, sub stores 10 - 5, mul stores 10 * 5, and div stores 10 / 5.
The last line tests division by zero, which is invalid in mathematics. The program checks for this and handles it properly (as we’ll see later).
*******************
5. Printing Results
The results of the operations are printed to the console using System.out.println().

java
Copy code
System.out.println("Addition: 10 + 5 = " + add);
System.out.println("Subtraction: 10 - 5 = " + sub);
System.out.println("Multiplication: 10 * 5 = " + mul);
System.out.println("Division: 10 / 5 = " + div);
System.out.println("Division by zero: " + divResult);

It will output the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
If the user tries to divide by zero, a message is printed, and the result is shown as 0.
********************************
6. Method Definitions
Now, let’s explain each method that does the actual calculations:

a. Addition Method (add)
This method takes two integers a and b as input and returns their sum.
java
Copy code
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
For example, if you pass 10 and 5, it returns 15.
b. Subtraction Method (subtract)
This method takes two integers a and b and returns their difference.
java
Copy code
public int subtract(int a, int b) {
    return a - b;
}
For example, if you pass 10 and 5, it returns 5.
c. Multiplication Method (multiply)
This method takes two integers a and b and returns their product.
java
Copy code
public int multiply(int a, int b) {
    return a * b;
}
For example, if you pass 10 and 5, it returns 50.
d. Division Method (divide)
This method takes two integers a and b, divides a by b, and returns the result as a double (to handle decimal points).
It also checks if b is zero, which would cause a division by zero error. If b == 0, the program prints an error message and returns 0.
java
Copy code
public double divide(int a, int b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        System.out.println("Error: Division by zero is undefined.");
        return 0; // Return 0 to avoid the error
    }
    return (double) a / b;
}
For example:
If you pass 10 and 5, it returns 2.0.
If you pass 10 and 0, it prints an error message and returns 0.
7. Handling Division by Zero
The method checks if the divisor (b) is zero. If it is, it avoids the division, prints a message, and safely returns 0 instead of causing a crash.
Final Output Example:
When the program runs, it will output something like this:

vbnet
Copy code
Addition: 10 + 5 = 15
Subtraction: 10 - 5 = 5
Multiplication: 10 * 5 = 50
Division: 10 / 5 = 2.0
Error: Division by zero is undefined.
Division by zero: 0.0
Summary:
Object-Oriented Approach: You create an object (calculator) to call the methods for basic arithmetic.
Methods for Operations: The methods add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide() perform the math.
Error Handling: The program checks for division by zero to avoid errors.
User-Friendly Output: The results of each operation are printed neatly for the user to see.
